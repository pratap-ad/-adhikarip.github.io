The project II is about to automate using R to produce the reports. I have read in and analyzed an online news popularity data set. Shares is the response variable to measure 
the popularity. The model is fitted for everyweek weekdays with their respective subset data. As in the previous project, I think this project has covered all of the major techniques
we have learnt so far. Therefore, I think this is the best approach to get practice to put the education into work to solve the realworld problems. The most difficult part for 
me was in figuring out the use of params to use in the filter function, so that it can be used to reach the variable to compare and retrieve the observations I needed. The most 
important part of this project is the Automoation and understanding how efficient it is for the data scientists who deals with the very big data and reproduction of the similar 
kinds of reports with very few changes in attributes and frequencies of report generation.
