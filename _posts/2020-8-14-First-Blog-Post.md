title: Data Scientist and Statistician!
---

Being a data scientist is about extracting the useful information from data pool with ease focusing/developing machine learning algorithms and being able to data story telling. 
The data scientists should have knowledge about the statistics, computer science and specific domain to get the insights by ingesting the data. Also, should have the knowledge about data analysis, model selection, model evaluation and communicating the results.

At least the scale of data dealt by the data scientists and statisticians is kind of incomparable since statisticians still rely on traditional and smaller scale collection method of data like surveys, experiments, polls etc., but they, data scientists and statistician, are kind of complementary to each other often times at the time of solving the problems. Both play with the data and the purpose of collecting the data is same i.e. to get the useful information but the approaches are different. For example, Data scientists formulate the problems using a modelling process focused on predictive accuracy of the model and it is done by comparing different machine learning algorithms and selecting the best accurate model. whereas statisticians take different approach to building and testing their model.

I have dealt only with the structured and small-scale data. Therefore, the knowledge I have so far, refers to be more about the statistician but I believe this will lead towards the data science world with strong statistical background.
