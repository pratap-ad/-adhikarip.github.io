No major changes about the perspective of data scientist and what they do that are mentioned in the first blog post
 about Data Scientist and Statistician. Still the thoughts about the R is same that it has very sort syntax to execute a very heavy data 
analysis.

Obviously there is not much doubt that I will be continuing using R going forward. But I have not found a single
job discription that has requirement of having knowledge on R only. There is python or some other languages embeded in the
qualification requirements. One may be work on other programming languages as well.

I think it would have been very very beneficial if we have got a collaboration with any institutions and work for them on real time data as a project work, 
even voluntarialy.
