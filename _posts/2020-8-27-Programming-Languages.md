The programming languages I am introduced so far are SAS, R  and FORTRAN. I also had tried to self learn Python and SQL programming languages and executed some basic codeBefore I started Masters in NC-State University, I was a base SAS certified programmer. During my bachelor's degree, I had FORTRAN as a course requirement. .

Of course there are pros and cons on all of the programming languages.  I can't say much about the PYTHON, but what I have percept during the self learning period is that Python is even more advance to R. Comparing to all of programming languages I know, I think R is more user friendly. R does not require any long steps to follow inorder get primary calculations and even on higher level statistical analysis using built in  or using the different packages' functions. So, I would love to say R is fast, fluent and fun to execute.
