I am introduced with the three programming languages so far; SAS, R  and FORTRAN. Before I start Masters in NC-State University, I was a base SAS certified programmer. 
During my bachelor's degree, I had FORTRAN as a course requirement. Comparing to the other two langauges that I know, I think R is more user friendly. R does not 
require any long steps to follow inorder get primary calculations and even on higher level statistical calculations using built in functions or using the different packages.
